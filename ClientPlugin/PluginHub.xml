  <Description>Phyzix - Space Engineers Entity Streaming Optimizer

⚠️ EARLY RELEASE - Please report any issues!

Phyzix eliminates the massive freezes that occur when Space Engineers loads many entities at once, particularly asteroids on heavily modded servers.

KEY FEATURES:
• Spreads entity loading across multiple frames (no more 5-10 second freezes!)
• Prioritizes important entities (spawn points, nearby objects)
• Defers physics creation for better performance
• Fully configurable batch sizes and timing
• Self-healing system for stuck entities

PERFECT FOR:
• Servers with dynamic asteroid spawning
• Heavy MES (Modular Encounters Systems) usage
• Any server where you experience freezing when new areas load

The plugin works by intercepting entity loading requests and processing them gradually instead of all at once. This maintains smooth 60+ FPS even during heavy streaming.

Default settings work great for most users, but everything is configurable through the Plugin Loader UI.
